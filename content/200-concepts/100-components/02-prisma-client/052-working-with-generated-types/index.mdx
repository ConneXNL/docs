<TopBlock>

The generated code for Prisma Client contains several helpful types that you can use to make your application more type-safe. This page describes patterns for leveraging some of the generated types.

By importing the `Prisma` namespace from `@prisma/client` you can access types related to your defined schema models.

The following example composes a `select` param outside of the queries context using the [`validator`](#prisma-validator) function, it passes in a generated type (`UserSelect`) meaning only fields available on a `select` can be used.

```ts
// Import the Prisma namespace from the client package
import { PrismaClient, Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// Pass in the UserSelect type assertion
const selectId = Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserSelect>()({
    id: true,
})

const data = await prisma.user.findFirst({ select: selectId })
```

> Note that you can find all type definitions inside the `index.d.ts` file inside the [generated `.prisma/client` folder](working-with-prismaclient/generating-prisma-client#the-prismaclient-npm-package).

### <inlinecode>Prisma validator</inlinecode>

The `validator` is a function that exists on the Prisma namespace. It helps you create re-usable query parameters based on your schema models while making sure that the objects you create are valid.

You can also wrap a `validator` function and accept input, they can then be used when interacting with user created data, such as form inputs.

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// Create a new function that wraps the validator function and accepts input.
// Create a new user and a post from user input
const createUserAndPost = (name: string, email: string, postTitle: string, profileBio: string) => {
  return Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserCreateInput>()({
        name,
        email,
        posts: {
          create: {
            title: postTitle
          }
        },
        profile: {
          create: {
            bio: profileBio
          }
        }
    })
}

// Find a specific user from user input
const findSpecificUser = (name: string, email: string) => {
  return Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserWhereInput>()({
    name,
    email
  })
}

// Create the user in the database
await prisma.user.create({ data: createUserAndPost })

// Can be used to find a specific user based on form input
const oneUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: findSpecificUser('Rich', 'rich@boop.com') })
```

The `createUserAndPost` custom function is created using the `validator` and passing a generated type (`UserCreateInput`) to the type assertion of the function. This generated type comes from your schema models.
The type assertion means that only fields that can be used when creating a user can be called inside the function.

See the [modal query options](../../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#model-query-options) reference for more information about the different types available.
